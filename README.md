# Flood Area Segmentation Project

This project focuses on the development of a flood area segmentation model using a dataset containing images of flood-hit areas and corresponding mask images showing the water regions. The objective is to create an accurate segmentation model capable of delineating the water regions in flood images.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following components:

- **Images**: This folder contains a total of 290 images of flood-hit areas. These images serve as the input for the segmentation model.

- **Masks**: The "Mask" folder contains mask images that correspond to the flood images. Each mask image is annotated to highlight the water regions within the respective flood image.

- **metadata.csv**: This CSV file serves as a mapping between the image filenames and their corresponding masks. It facilitates the association of flood images with their respective ground truth masks.

## Project Overview

- **Task**: The primary task of this project is to develop a segmentation model that accurately identifies and segments the water regions within flood images.

- **Challenges**: Due to the limited size of the dataset (290 images), the project may employ techniques such as data augmentation to enhance model performance.

## Usage

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that the dataset is properly organized with flood images in the "Image" folder and their corresponding masks in the "Mask" folder. Use the provided metadata.csv for reference.

3. **Training**: Train the segmentation model using the provided dataset. Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to achieve the best results.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance on the validation set using metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice Coefficient, and more.

5. **Inference**: Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it for segmenting flood-hit areas in new images.
